title: "Sparklines - A neat alternative to figures"
---
Sometimes, you'll want to convey (or remind) the reader about some fact or data that is more intuitively understood when represented graphically.
For this reason, we have figures: pictures that are signposted by a label. Generally, they will take up enough space (or are difficult enough to typeset) that consideration must be put into whether the information is significant enough to warrant the costs.
For this reason, some journals even place a limit on the number of tables or figures.

This is where sparklines make their entrance. For quickly graphically representing a subset or feature of previously presented data, a text-sized plot without axes is included in the text.
