title: "Typst packages - Why and How?"
---

As of writing (version 0.11.1), Typst is rapidly approaching feature parity with LaTeX. However, as must necessarily be the case with anything new: the ecosystem to support it is still growing. Therefore, those who choose Typst will run into a problem sooner or later: "The package I need just doesn't exist yet"

If at this point you choose nonetheless to persist with Typst, you'll generally have a crack at implementing something that suits your specific use case, as was the case for me in a previous blog post about sparklines or table notes. 

As I've recently been working on putting together some packages, now seems like a good a time as any to discuss the step that follows: sharing your implementation so others don't run into the same speedbump.

# The directory layout
At a minimum, a package consists of a manifest file (`typst.toml`), and an entry point (a typst file, generally `lib.typ` but you can choose whatever name). Generally though, you might want to include other files too, and very quickly it becomes a challenge to keep track of which files belong where. For this reason, the typst-community github organisation have put together a package-template repository. This section will go through how to get it setup and explain the lay of the land.

The first task is to fork the template repository. Navigate to https://github.com/typst-community/typst-package-template, and give it a name in the next menu. As of writing, there is no reason to change any of the defaults.

You should then have a repository to version control your package and to collaborate with others (just because it works for your use-case doesn't mean other people can't expand upon it). 

There are between 2 to 3 different ways your package will end up being bundled, each a slimmed down version of the previous:
- This repository: All files
- Package repository: manifest, source, documentation PDF, README.md and any files it depends on, LICENSE
- What is sent to the consumer of your package when imported: source and assets that are required by your package such as images and fonts
- (for templates) Files that should make up a newly created projectusing the template: an entry point and example assets?

Therefore, it is important to keep in mind which files should make it to which stage, or, keep your directory structures meaningful. The template repository we picked opts for the directory structure:

- `/docs/` contains `manual.typ` (this repository) and `manual.pdf` (also package repository)
- `/scripts/` are kept only on this repository
- `/src/` goes all the way to the consumer
- `/tests/` this repository only

This behaviour is defined explicitly in `.typstignore` (which concerns which files shouldn't move from this repository to the package repository) and the manifest file `typst.toml` (which concerns which files shouldn't move from the package repository to the consumer)

There are instructions for how to use the repository in `README.md`, so this guide will only go through things I found tricky when doing it myself.

# `just` Do It
This template repository ships with some nifty scripts that are invoked using `just`. I won't cover how to install it, but I will detail what scripts are made available to you and why they might be useful.

- `just ci` will make sure your tests don't fail and then compile the documentation for you
- `just doc` will compile the documentation
- `just install` is the first step to testing that your package is shipable: It installs it locally under the `@local` namespace, so you can test importing it.
- `just install-preview` does the same but under the `@preview` namespace
- `just package` bundles everything will excluding things that shouldn't be sent to the package repository.
- `just test` and `just update` concern running tests and updating their reference images respectively
- `just uninstall` and `just uninstall-preview` will uninstall packages from your local computer.


I don't end up running these commands manually very often because of the release workflow I'll discuss in the next section, but if you're unsure and you want to dry-run a release, `ci` and `package` are the commands which are quite diagnostic.

# The release workflow
Once you've taken care of everything, and then taken care of the things you forgot about (incrementing the package version in the manifest, updating the changelog, making sure the documentation is up to date), and tested that your package works when imported locally, its time to make a pull request into the package repository. This can be a faff to do manually, so the package template comes bundled with some github actions that will do the heavy lifting for us (as long as we do some lifting to get it setup first).

First things first, if we are doing a pull request into the package repository, we are going to need our own fork, which you can get started on here: https://github.com/typst/packages/fork. I strongly recommend naming the fork repository "typst-packages".

Now, in our previous repository (the one for our package), navigate to `.github/workflows/release.yml` and make sure that line 10 properly points to this form we made.

We need to give our workflow permission to do this heavy lifting for us (`ci`, `package`, make a new branch on the fork, copy our release into the right folders and commit), which is achieved by creating a creating a fin-grained personal access token (https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta). By generating a new token, selecting "Only select repositories" and choosing the "typst-packages" repo, and giving read-write access to `contents` as shown in the picture:

Once you've generated it, you will be given a key. Copy this (as you won't be shown this again, you'll need to delete it and redo the steps if you loose it) and keep it secret (as in, same level as "password" secret). The one shown in the picture is 

![Expression]({{ "/assets/2024-07-09-packages/setup-3.png" | relative_url }})

The last thing to do now is to tell our github actions this key (which is in effect giving it those permissions). On GitHub, navigate to `settings/secrets/actions` on your repository, and add the new key
