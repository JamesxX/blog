title: "Typst packages - Why and How?"
---

As of writing (version 0.11.1), Typst is rapidly approaching feature parity with LaTeX. However, as must necessarily be the case with anything new: the ecosystem to support it is still growing. Therefore, those who choose Typst will run into a problem sooner or later: "The package I need just doesn't exist yet"

If at this point you choose nonetheless to persist with Typst, you'll generally have a crack at implementing something that suits your specific use case, as was the case for me in a previous blog post about sparklines or table notes. 

As I've recently been working on putting together some packages, now seems like a good a time as any to discuss the step that follows: sharing your implementation so others don't run into the same speedbump.

# The directory layout
At a minimum, a package consists of a manifest file (`typst.toml`), and an entry point (a typst file, generally `lib.typ` but you can choose whatever name). Generally though, you might want to include other files too, and very quickly it becomes a challenge to keep track of which files belong where. For this reason, the typst-community github organisation have put together a package-template repository. This section will go through how to get it setup and explain the lay of the land.

The first task is to fork the template repository. Navigate to https://github.com/typst-community/typst-package-template, and
